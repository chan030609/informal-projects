# Informal Projects
This is where I upload casual, informal projects using various datasets and information available online.

Projects are sorted in the descending order of dates.
- [Data Analysis](#data-analysis) - data cleaning, visualization, inspection, etc.
- [Machine Learning](#machine-learning) - artificiall intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, etc.

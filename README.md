This is where I upload casual, informal projects using various information, libraries, and datasets available online.

Projects are sorted in the __descending order of dates__.
- [Data Analysis](#data-analysis) - data cleaning, visualization, inspection, etc.
- [Machine Learning](#machine-learning) - artificiall intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, etc.

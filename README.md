This is where I upload side projects by using information, libraries, languages, and datasets available online.
Works other than [Mini-projects](##mini-projects) are not included in this repository. The projects are sorted in the __descending order of dates__, the most recent one being at the top.

- [AI Projects and Researches](##ai-projects-and-researches) - artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning projects and researches.
- [Mini-projects](##mini-projects) - casual projects and exercises.
